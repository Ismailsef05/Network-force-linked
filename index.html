    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>
      Morocco has the most strategic location of all Africa. 
    </p>  
    <p>I will create nodes of countries and link them between them if a country is in a 6 000 km range from the other border of other countries.
        <br>I chose the countries which have a significant economical power. Then we are going to see which country from the Africa has most edges. </p>

                  const spec1 = "bar2.vg.json";
                  vegaEmbed("#bar", spec1)
                    // result.view provides access to the Vega View API
                    .then(result => console.log(result))
                    .catch(console.warn);
                </script>
                    
          </div>

 We can see that Morocco has more edges than the countries I chose to compare with. The choice of countries was not easy to make in order to stay as fair as possible.
 <br> My two main sources were: Google maps, and this website to know the exact distances: <br>
